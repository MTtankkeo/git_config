# Introduction
A Dart CLI to fetch config files from a remote Git repository into the project.

## Usage
This section covers the basic usage of this package and how to integrate it into your application.

### Adding Config File
Add a JSON file named `git_config.json` in the project root folder. Adjust the contents from the example as needed.

```json
{
  "remote": {
    "owner": "organization or your name",
    "repository": "repository",
    "branch": "main"
  }
}
```

Next, itâ€™s simple. Run the following command in the terminal at the path where the config file is located. The contents of the repository defined in the config file will then be copied into your project.
